; Use five saw oscillators
N: 5
swarm: [N] Saw_Oscillator~ 

; Random offset frequencies
offset: [N] Multiply~ random(-100, 100)

; The base frequency for each oscillator will
; be added to the offset
base_frequency: [N] Add~ n * 55

; Use a Timer~ to decrease the amount of offset over time
; Tanh~ is used to stop the timer exceeding 1
Timer~
-> Tanh~ -> *-1 -> +1
<> offset
=> base_frequency
=> swarm
>> *0.1 -> output
