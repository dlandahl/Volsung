Recreate ambient objects on parsing the program

Automatically fall back to asm.js

Allow request buffer size per input channel

eg~ should output gate

Write all the overloads

Move overloads into classes of typed values?

Use references to blocks for signal flow, automatically copy blocks when needed

Use an array of make_object functions to improve branch prediction

Add named parameters to subgraphs
    -> This may allow static analysis of subgraph validity, without a dynamic instance

Update subgraph syntax

Add Parameter~ / param~ object

Rename objects with longer, more descriptive names?

Add functions, load files into sequences instead
