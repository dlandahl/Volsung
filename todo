count_nodes should recurse into subgraphs properly

Envelope_Generator~ should output gate
    -> There is a bad bug, where multiple outputs causes double free on shared pointer

Write concatenation operator

Write modulo operator

Add named parameters to subgraphs
    -> This may allow static analysis of subgraph validity, without a dynamic instance

Add Parameter~ object

Warn or error when implicitly discarding imaginary part of number

Use references to sequences when initialising objects to save memory in case of large pcm data

Pole~, Zero~ should be complex

Probably remove Z_Plane~

Create bytecode
