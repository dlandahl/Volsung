Recreate ambient objects on parsing the program

Automatically fall back to asm.js

eg~ should output gate
There is a bad bug, where multiple outputs causes double free on shared pointer

Write concatenation operator

Add named parameters to subgraphs
    -> This may allow static analysis of subgraph validity, without a dynamic instance

Add Parameter~ / param~ object

Add functions, load files into sequences instead

Warn or error when discarding imaginary part of number

Use references to sequences when initialising objects to save memory in case of large pcm data
