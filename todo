Recreate ambient objects on parsing the program

Automatically fall back to asm.js

Allow request buffer size per input channel

eg~ should output gate
There is a bad bug, where multiple outputs causes double free on shared pointer

Write all the overloads

Move overloads into classes of types?

Use references to blocks for signal flow, automatically copy blocks when needed

Use an array of make_object functions to improve branch prediction

Add named parameters to subgraphs
    -> This may allow static analysis of subgraph validity, without a dynamic instance

Update subgraph syntax

Add Parameter~ / param~ object

Add functions, load files into sequences instead

Declaring objects in connection statements is allowed, but not if it's the first object in a path??
